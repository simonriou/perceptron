SCIENTIFIC COMPUTATION PROJECT - SIMON RIOU & CLEMENT MELKIOR

Folder Organization:

	•	The perceptron.m file contains the code for a single-layer perceptron, trained and tested on the DataSimulation dataset.
	•	The digit.m file contains the code for binary classification of two digits.
	•	The monocouche.m file contains the code for “1 vs all” classification of digits.

Binary Classification Functionality:

	•	To choose the two digits for classification, modify line 4 of the digit.m file.

Single-Layer Network Functionality:

	•	When the program starts, the interactive menu allows you to choose between training or testing the network.
	•	To select the number of digits and which digits to classify, modify the list on line 5 of the monocouche.m file.
	•	Make sure to run the test after training on the correct number of digits.
	•	The test displays the confusion matrix of the network.

Remaining Tasks:

	•	Implement a network with a hidden layer.
